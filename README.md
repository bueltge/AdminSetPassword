AdminSetPassword for MantisBT
=============================

Works with MantisBT 1.2.14.

This plugin for Mantis Bugtracker allows administrators to set a new password directly.
If you installed this plugin, you get a password input field on manage_user_edit_page.php and a button to set the new password - that's all.

No configuration options, no config page. And nothing to patch in your mantis installation.
